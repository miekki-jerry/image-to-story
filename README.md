# Image to Story Generator
## Description
This project uses multimodals to convert images into a short story. It's built on Streamlit and offers the option to choose between Hugging Face multimodal and Lava-13b for image captioning.
Story generation is working thanks to LangChain.

## Features
- Upload an image to generate a story based on it.
- Choose between Hugging Face and Lava-13b models.
- You can hear stories thanks to Hugging Face text-to-speech model.

## Disclaimer
I built this project because I wanted to know better the Hugging Face API, LangChain, replicate API and multimodals, such as Lava-13b.
To get better text to speech quality it's better to use Eleven Labs.
